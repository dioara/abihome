## Website Structure Plan

Based on the analysis of the Abihomes website, I'll create a static site with the following structure:

### HTML Files
- index.html (Homepage)
- about.html (About Us page)
- projects.html (Projects listing page)
- services.html (Services page)
- partners.html (Partners page)
- contact.html (Contact page)
- projects/omega-apartments.html (Project detail page)
- projects/hale-barns.html (Project detail page)
- projects/premium-new-build.html (Project detail page)

### CSS Files
- css/style.css (Main stylesheet)
- css/responsive.css (Mobile responsiveness)

### JavaScript Files
- js/main.js (Main functionality - navigation, form validation, etc.)

### Assets Directory
- assets/images/ (All website images)
- assets/fonts/ (Any custom fonts if needed)

### Features to Implement
1. Responsive navigation menu with mobile toggle
2. Hero sections with background images
3. Card-based project listings
4. Contact form with validation
5. Footer with social links and copyright
6. Testimonials section
7. Services showcase
8. Partners/team showcase

### Libraries/Frameworks to Consider
- Bootstrap (for responsive grid and components)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- Google Fonts (for typography)
